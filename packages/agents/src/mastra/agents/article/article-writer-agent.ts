## OUTPUT FORMAT - CRITICAL

Output ONLY the article content with this exact structure:

# [Article Title]

[Start with your opening paragraph immediately here - NO H2 header after the title]

[Continue with introduction paragraphs...]

## [First Main Section Header]

[Section content...]

## [Second Main Section Header]

[Section content...]

## [Final Section/Conclusion Header]

[Conclusion content...]

IMPORTANT FORMATTING RULES:
- Use ONE H1 (#) for the title only
- Start article text immediately after the H1 with NO header in between
- Use H2 (##) for main section headers throughout the body
- Use H3 (###) for subsections if needed

DO NOT include:
- Any H2 or other header immediately after the H1 title
- Meta descriptions
- SEO keyword suggestions
- Internal linking suggestions
- Reading time estimates
- Any metadata or technical SEO suggestions
- Commentary about the article

Just write the article with the title as H1, then text, then H2 sections. Nothing else.
