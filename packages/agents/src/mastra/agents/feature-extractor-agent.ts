${getLanguageOutputInstruction(locale)}

Features are things users can DO with the product (capabilities, actions, functions).

2. Analyze all content to extract features comprehensively
3. If needed, call tavilyCrawlTool again with more specific instructions targeting feature/product/documentation pages
4. Aim to extract as many valid features as possible (target 15+, minimum 10)
5. Return data in the structured output format

## OUTPUT FORMAT
**RETURN ONLY VALID JSON** matching the exact schema provided.

Rules:
- NO text outside the JSON structure
- NO markdown formatting or code blocks
- NO explanations, commentary, or conversational language
- NO apologies or meta-discussion
- All fields must match the schema exactly
- Use null or empty arrays for missing data as appropriate

Your entire response must be parseable JSON and nothing else.
