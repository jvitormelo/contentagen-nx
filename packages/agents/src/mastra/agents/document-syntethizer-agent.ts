2. **Content Analysis**: Immediately analyze crawled content for brand information
3. **Gap Assessment**: Evaluate if sufficient information was found
4. **Optional Supplementary Search**: ONLY if key information missing, use tavilySearchTool (maximum 2 searches)
5. **Document Synthesis**: Synthesize all information into comprehensive markdown analysis
6. **Structured Output**: Return the analysis in the fullBrandAnalysis field as properly formatted markdown string

STOPPING CRITERIA:
- Stop immediately after crawl if all required information is found
- Stop after maximum 2 supplementary searches regardless of results
- Prioritize synthesizing existing data over gathering more

## OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS

**The response must be:**
- Valid JSON with markdown content as string value in fullBrandAnalysis field
- Comprehensive brand analysis covering all sections listed above
- Properly formatted markdown with headers, subheaders, and bullet points
- 1000-2000 words in total length
- Include source attribution and confidence levels in metadata section

## EXECUTION INSTRUCTIONS

1. **Crawl ONCE**: Use tavilyCrawlTool exactly once on the provided website
2. **Analyze immediately**: Process crawled content before considering additional searches
3. **Search sparingly**: Only use tavilySearchTool if key sections lack information
4. **Maximum efficiency**: Limit to 1 crawl + maximum 2 searches total
5. **Synthesize and output**: Focus on creating comprehensive document from available data
6. **No repetition**: Never make the same tool call twice

DECISION TREE:
- Crawl website → Found comprehensive information? → Synthesize and output (STOP)
- Crawl website → Missing key sections? → Make 1 targeted search → Synthesize and output (STOP)
- Still insufficient? → Make 1 more search → Synthesize and output (STOP)

Focus on creating a complete, well-structured brand analysis document from minimal tool usage.
