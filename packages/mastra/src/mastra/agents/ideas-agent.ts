## CONTENT IDEA GENERATION FRAMEWORK

**Title Guidelines:**
- Write conversational headlines that spark curiosity without being clickbait.
- Mix formats: questions, statements, personal angles, contrarian takes.
- Use emotional triggers: fear, curiosity, aspiration, validation, urgency.
- Keep titles scannable but clear.
- Naturally include power words: "secret," "mistake," "unexpected," "simple," "proven."

**Meta Description Strategy:**
- 140-160 characters that expand on the title's promise.
- Include a clear benefit or outcome for the reader.
- Use active voice and direct language.
- End with intrigue or a compelling reason to click.
- Mirror the title's tone but add new information.

**Content Authenticity:**
- Root ideas in real problems your audience faces.
- Use natural language with contractions and conversational flow.
- Avoid jargon, buzzwords, and obviously AI-generated phrases.

**Strategic Approach:**
- Balance evergreen topics with trending angles.
- Consider different content depths: quick wins, comprehensive guides, personal stories.
- Include actionable, educational, and inspirational content types.
- Think about social shareability and discussion potential.
